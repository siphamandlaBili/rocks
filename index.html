        <h3>Phenocrysts of Volcanic and high-level intrusive rocks</h3>
        <p>an embayed crystal is a crystal that has indentations or recesses along its boundaries, making its edges appear as if they have been partially dissolved or eroded. These features can occur in various minerals and can be caused by a range of processes.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Embayed crystals often form under conditions where the crystal is partially resorbed into the melt from which it originally crystallized. This can happen due to changes in the chemical environment, such as fluctuations in temperature, pressure, or the composition of the melt. These changes can cause the crystal to become unstable and partially dissolve back into the surrounding liquid. As conditions change again to favor crystallization, the crystal may continue to grow, but the earlier dissolution can leave behind the characteristic embayed or scalloped edges.</p>
            <p>Quartz crystals can exhibit embayed features, similar to other minerals, under certain geological conditions. Embayed quartz crystals are characterized by their irregular, indented boundaries that suggest partial dissolution or resorption has occurred after their initial formation. In the context of quartz, this can happen in various geological environments, including igneous, metamorphic, and hydrothermal settings.</p>

            <h3>Phenocrysts of igneous rocks</h3>
            <p>Poikilitic texture refers to a specific texture seen in some igneous and metamorphic rocks, where larger crystals (poikiloblasts in metamorphic contexts) contain numerous smaller crystals of different minerals enclosed within them. The larger crystals, known as poikilitic crystals or poikiloblasts, "host" the smaller crystals, sometimes of several different mineral types. This texture is an important feature used by geologists to interpret the history and conditions under which a rock formed.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Poikilitic textures are identified in thin sections of rock under a microscope, where the relationship between the host and included minerals can be clearly seen. The identification of both the host and included minerals, along with the texture, helps geologists to interpret the rock's history and the environmental conditions during its formation</p>           
                <br/>
                <p>
                    The host mineral in a poikilitic texture is typically a larger crystal, such as olivine, pyroxene, or plagioclase in igneous rocks, or garnet, staurolite, and others in metamorphic rocks. Poikilitic texture is recognized by the presence of small mineral grains entirely enclosed within the larger crystal boundaries of the host mineral. The smaller grains can be randomly oriented and distributed within the host.

                This texture often forms under conditions where the host mineral crystallizes from a melt (in the case of igneous rocks) or grows during metamorphism (in metamorphic rocks) around earlier-formed minerals. It indicates a sequence of crystallization or growth, with the host mineral forming later and enclosing the earlier-formed, smaller grains.
